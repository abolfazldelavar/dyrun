# Dynamic Runner (DYRUN)

This Python-based basement environment is designed for simulating dynamical systems, including differential equations, and visualizing their results, which can be particularly useful for academic research and paper presentations. `dyrun` is a simple tool that facilitates simulations expeditiously and effortlessly, using invaluable instruments for modeling linear and nonlinear dynamic systems. This formidable instrument is capable of executing **differential mathematical equations** [1] and is advantageous for

* **Control engineering**,
* **Estimation** [2, 3],
* **Encryption** [4],
* and **Neuroscience** [5, 6].

Researchers who wish to delve into the realm of dynamic and control systems will find this package to be an invaluable resource.
