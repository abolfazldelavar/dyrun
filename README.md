Faryadell Simulation Framework (FSF) is a basement environment in python that can be utilized to simulation dynamical systems such as differential equations and illustration of their results for academic papers. To be exact, it was managed to use in control engineering simulations, neural networks, and so forth. If you are a student who wants to investigate and has decided to seek dynamic and control systems, this is for you. Enjoy it :_)
